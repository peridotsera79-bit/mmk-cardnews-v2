no digital smoothing, no HDR, slightly desaturated, magazine scan feel,

## Text Zone Templates

Insert into prompts based on card layout:

### FullBleed — text at bottom (most common)
```

lower 35% fades to darker tones suitable for white text overlay,
bottom area intentionally subdued for text legibility
```

### Cover — text at center
```
high contrast image with both deep shadow and bright highlight areas,
subject distributed around frame edges with breathing room at center,
center area suitable for overlaid text regardless of placement
```

### Split — text on left
```
subject fills right 55% of frame,
left 45% is clean negative space or shallow soft background,
horizontal composition, left area reserved for text column
```

### Minimal — minimal text (SWITCH/Pen)
```
subject isolated center-frame with generous equal margins all sides,
subject occupies maximum 40% of total frame area,
surrounding space is clean, low-texture, single-tone
```

## Aspect Ratio Mismatch Warning

Canvas = **4:5** (1080x1350), Gemini closest = **3:4** (1792x2400).
3:4 is slightly taller than 4:5, so `objectFit: "cover"` will crop ~6% off left/right edges.

**When writing prompts:**
- Keep the main subject **centered horizontally**
- Do not place important elements at extreme left/right edges
- Ensure sufficient horizontal margin when declaring text zones
- Composition keyword: `"subject centered horizontally, avoid important elements at extreme left/right edges"`

---

## Gemini-Specific Notes

- Hex color values work directly: `"background color #F5F0E8"`
- Understands film stock names: Kodak Portra 400, Fuji Superia 200, Ilford HP5
- Understands camera specs: f/2.8, ISO 400, 35mm, medium format
- Use ratio language: `"subject occupies 40% of frame"`
- Use zone language: `"upper-left reserved for text"`
- No separate negative prompt parameter — include as `avoid:` within the prompt
- Do not use abstract mood words alone (`melancholy`, `hopeful`) — always pair with visual anchors
- Text generation is unreliable — always emphasize "DO NOT include text"
